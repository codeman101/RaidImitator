# RaidImitator 

This is a program I wrote for a friend. The program imitates RAID 1 off a given directory.
It get the paths it reads from by reading a configuration text file in your Documents folder.
The first line it reads from the file is the directory it monitors and second second line is the directory it 
copies to.
